# AutoImageCaption
CaptionBot aims to automatically generate a sentence description for an image. Our project model will take an image as input and generate an English sentence as output, describing the contents of the image. It has attracted much research attention in cognitive computing in recent years. The task is rather complex, as the concepts of both computer vision and natural language processing domains are combined together. We have developed a model using the concepts of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model and build a working model of Image caption generator by implementing CNN with LSTM. CNN works as an encoder to extract features from images and LSTM works as a decoder to generate words describing images. After the caption generation phase, we useBLEUScores to evaluate the efficiency of our model. Thus, our system helps the user to get descriptive caption for the given input image. To deploy our model as a web application, we have used Flask, which is a powerful Python's web framework.
